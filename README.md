# Copper age

Copper Age brings copper into its long-overdue role as a functional material in Minecraft.
This datapack and accompanying resourcepack add fully usable copper tools, weapons, and armor â€” all with unique models and full support for armor trims.
The gear is balanced between stone and iron, making copper a viable early-game upgrade path. Designed for seamless integration with vanilla gameplay.

## Features

- Adds crafting recipes for:
  - Copper sword, axe, pickaxe, shovel, hoe
  - Full set of copper armor (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
- All armor pieces are compatible with armor trims
- Custom resourcepack for unique copper gear textures and models
- Balanced stats:
  - Stronger than stone, but weaker than iron
  - Appropriate durability and damage values
- No loot tables or vanilla items modified

## Installation

- Download the [datapack and resourcepack](https://github.com/Neluxx/copper-age/releases/latest)
- Move the datapack inside ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks`` ([How to find .minecraft?](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft#Locating))
- Move the resourcepack inside ``.minecraft/resourcepacks`` ([How to load a resourcepack?](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Behavior))
- Reload the world or run ``/reload``

## Uninstalling

- Delete the datapack from ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks``
- Delete the resourcepack from ``.minecraft/resourcepacks``
- Note: Copper items will no longer be craftable (already crafted items remain unless removed manually but have no texture)
